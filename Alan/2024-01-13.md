	* Ans: Generally speaking, I believe that TV has a positive influence on society because that's what I learned from my experience. Take me for example, I used to watch TV shows after school, from cartoons to entertainment shows. It helps me release my pressure, and forget the bad things that happened during the day. Sometimes, I also watch some channels like National Geographic. They show us amazing places around the world and teach us about wildlife and different cultures. So, I think watching TV is beneficial to all of us.
