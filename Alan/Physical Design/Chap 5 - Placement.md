	* Cluster growth
* Nondeterministic methods
	* Simulated annealing (SA)
* Analytical methods
	* Force-directed placement
	* Quadratic placement (QP)
	* Non-quadratic placement
* HPWL Wirelength Model
	* Log-sum-exp (LSE)
	* Weighted-Average (WA)
* Mixed-size placement
	* Constructive: use floorplanning/placement
	* Three-stage approach
