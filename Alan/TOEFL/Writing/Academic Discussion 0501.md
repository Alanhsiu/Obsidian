In my opinion, grading followed by an external benchmark is better. I strongly agree with Stephen's idea, since benchmarks help student understand the standards and thus can check if they are meet them or not. In addition, I'd like to mention that the importance of an external benchmark, since it is more fair for every student. Take the TOEFL writing exam for example. If the organizer doesn't disclose the grading rules and give us the examples for different levels, we won't get to expect what score we should get. By doing so, it's open and clear to rank our works.
