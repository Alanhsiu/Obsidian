	* Ans: Generally speaking, I believe that TV has a positive influence on society because that's what I learned from my experience. Take me for example, I used to watch TV shows after school, from cartoons to entertainment shows. It helps me release my pressure, and forget the bad things that happened during the day. Sometimes, I also watch some channels like National Geographic. They show us amazing places around the world and teach us about wildlife and different cultures. So, I think watching TV is beneficial to all of us.
	* When I was a senior student, I was preparing for my college entrance exams, which were very important to me. I often felt stressed when I was at school, and I would always watch TV to help me relax.

	* Ans: I think it's better for students to study different subjects. Because it helps students broaden their horizons. For example, I majored in electrical engineering, but I took various courses outside my major field, like economics. It helps me cultivate diverse interests and know more about the world. Besides, I like to learn many things because I am curious about the unknown fields. So that's the reason why.

	* Ans: I prefer to work on class assignments in a group. Because it helps me work more efficiently. For example, my friends and I completed the programming assignment last weekend together. When we work together, we help each other understand difficult concepts, and come up with more creative solutions. Besides, I think group work also teaches us how to communicate with others efficiently, and that's an important skill to learn. So that's the reason why.
