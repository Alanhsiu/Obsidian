Professor Diaz:
This week we talked about how important taking time off from work or school is for people's well-being. Some people believe they get the most benefit when that time off is structured: that is it involves planning in advance about what will be accomplished on that day. Others believe it is better to enjoy the day with no plan for how to spend it. In this discussion post please indicate which of those approaches to spending time off from work on school you prefer and why?Â 

Claire:
I find it beneficial to do some advance planning for my free time. I live far away from my family so when I am getting ready to visit them during a school holiday, I always plan my time off from school very carefully. That way l have enough time to visit with each family member.

Paul:
Personally, I prefer not to make any plans for my free time. I go to school, and I have a part-time job each week. I make a schedule to be sure I can complete both my work and studies. So when I have time off from work and school, I just want to relax with no plan.

In my opinion, it is better to plan for our free time. I think Claire's idea makes sense because planning time carefully can give her enough time to visit her family. In addition, I'd like to mention the importance of planning for time off because it helps us to learn more efficiently. For example, I used to plan to take a TOEFL test, and I carefully arranged the time after school. I ask myself to listen to English podcasts when I take the bus home and memorize 10 new words after showering. Before going to bed, I practice a mock test for speaking and writing parts. By well organize my time, I finally get a high score on TOEFL test. Therefore, I believe that  it's important to plan in advance about what will be accomplished off time.

In my opinion, it is better to plan for our free time. Claire's idea of carefully planning her visits with family makes sense, as it ensures she has enough time to spend with everyone. Additionally, I believe planning is important because it helps us use our time more effectively for learning. For example, when preparing for the TOEFL test, I carefully arranged my after-school time. I listened to English podcasts on the bus, memorized 10 new words after showering, and practiced mock speaking and writing tests before bed. By organizing my time well, I was able to achieve a high score on the TOEFL. Therefore, I believe it's important to plan in advance to maximize the benefits of our time off.
