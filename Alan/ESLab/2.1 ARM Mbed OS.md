* Mbed OS
	* open-source OS using ARM microcontrollers
	* specifically for IoT devices: low-power
	* provide an **abstraction layer** for the microcontrollers (**Hardware Abstraction Layer, HAL**)
	* has an RTOS core → support **deterministic**, **multithreaded**, real-time software execution
* Semaphore
	* 一種用於控制對共享資源的訪問的同步機制
	* What is the effect or the meaning of the initial value of the semaphore?
		* The initial value of a semaphore determines **how many threads can access the shared resource it guards** without blocking immediately. 
		* If the initial value is set to 0, it means that the semaphore is in a locked state initially. 
		* If the initial value is set to 1, it means that only one task can access the resource at a time without waiting. 
		* If it's set to a higher value, multiple tasks can access the resource simultaneously.
	* Counting Semaphore: 可以取一個以上的值，用於控制可以同時訪問共享資源的最大線程數量。
	* Binary Semaphore: Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)，只能取兩個值，通常是0和1。
	* Semaphore is a more general mechanism and **some method can be used in an ISR** while **Mutex cannot be used in an ISR**.
* Conditional Variable
	* provides a mechanism to **safely wait for or signal state changes**
* EventQueue
	* provides a flexible queue for **scheduling events**
	* **thread safe**
		* code can be safely executed in a **multi-threaded** environment, avoiding issues due to concurrent access to shared resources.
	* **ISR (IRQ) safe**
		* code can be safely executed within an **interrupt context** without causing corruption due to interrupts.
	* 允許將耗時的任務或需要同步的操作從interrupt context中移出，避免在中斷服務常式（ISR）中執行可能導致延遲的操作。
	* dispatch
		* 將事件或任務分配給處理函數或線程的過程，用於執行相關的響應或操作。在EventQueue中，dispatch 會按順序執行隊列中的事件。
	* event (): create event and post parameter later
	* call (): calls an event on the queue and execute
