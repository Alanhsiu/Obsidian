* Synchronous
	* sender and receiver access the data according to **the same clock** 使用共同的CLK
	* **SPI**, **I2C**
* Asynchronous
	* **no common clock** signal between the sender and receivers
	* **UART**, Controller Area Network (**CAN** bus)
* UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter) [一對一]
	* low data rate: at least **one start and stop bit**
	* point-to-point connections 
* SPI (Serial Peripheral Interconnect) [一對多]
	* drawback: **the number of pins required**
	* a master to a slave → 4 lines (MISO, MOSI, SCK, CS1) (MOSI: Master In Slave Out)
	* each additional slave requires one additional chip select I/O pin on the master
* I2C (Inter-IC Communication) [多對多]
	* a multi-master bus
	* use ground line + two lines (**SCL**, **SDA**): Serial Clock, Serial Data
	* one extra bit of meta date (ACK/NACK) out of every 8 bits
	* hardware required: more complex than SPI, less than async serial.
	* I2C can be fairly trivially implemented in software. 用軟件來實現I2C協議是相對簡單的
	* The clock signal is always **generated by the current bus master**
		* some slave devices may **force the clock low** at times to delay the master sending more data → **clock stretching** 
	* **open drain**
		* they can pull the signal line low, but cannot drive it high → **Wired-AND**
		* each signal line has a common **pull-up resistor**

  * [I2C Protocol](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10269863?sc=rss.iron)
	* Start Condition: **SCL high**, **SDA low** (SDA low first) SDA先下後上
	* Stop Condition: **SCL high**, **SDA high** (SCL high first) SCL後下先上
	* Address Frame: 7-bit address (MSB first) + R/W bit (0: write, 1: read) + ACK
	* Data Frame: 8-bit data + ACK (0→ACK: OK, 1→NACK: 出錯)
	* I2C Arbitration
		* A master loses arbitration **when it cannot get either SCL or SDA to go high** 
		* 如果一個主機發送了高電平（釋放總線），但是檢測到總線上的電平實際上是低的（因為另一個主機正在拉低），它就知道發生了衝突。發現衝突的主機會立即停止傳輸並釋放總線，讓其他主機繼續通信。該主機會在稍後的時間再次嘗試通信。所以 **SDA 或 SCL 信號先走到低電位者可以獲得使用權**。
	* I2C Synchronization Mechanism
		* The slave that wants the master to wait simply **pulls the SCL low** as long as needed. this is like adding "wait states" to the I2C bus cycle. → **clock stretching**
		* You can make this technique rigid **by not pulling only the SCL line low, but also the SDA line.**
* What are the main differences I2C between SMbus (System Management Bus)?
	* I2C 沒有timeout、速度較快、傳輸的data量沒有限制
* What is the main difference between the bus master and the bus slave?
	* Bus Master: (1) **Initiates** and controls data transfers. (2) Addresses specific slaves.        (3) Responsible for **generating clock signals**.
	* Bus Slave:   (1) Responds to the master's requests.   (2) Cannot initiate communication. (3) Waits for the master's instructions to act.
