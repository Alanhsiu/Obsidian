* Synchronous
	* sender and receiver access the data according to **the same clock**
	* **SPI**, **I2C**
* Asynchronous
	* **no common clock** signal between the sender and receivers
	* **UART**, Controller Area Network (**CAN** bus)
* UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter) [一對一]
	* low data rate: at least **one start and stop bit**
	* point-to-point connections 
* SPI (Serial Peripheral Interconnect) [一對多]
	* drawback: **the number of pins required**
	* a master to a slave → 4 lines (MISO, MOSI, SCK, CS1) (MOSI: Master In Slave Out)
	* each additional slave requires one additional chip select I/O pin on the master
* I2C (Inter-IC Communication)
	* a multi-master bus
	* use only two lines (**SCL**, **SDA**) + ground line
