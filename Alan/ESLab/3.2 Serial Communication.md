* Synchronous
	* sender and receiver access the data according to **the same clock**
	* **SPI**, **I2C**
* Asynchronous
	* **no common clock** signal between the sender and receivers
	* **UART**, Controller Area Network (**CAN** bus)
* UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter) [一對一]
	* low data rate: at least **one start and stop bit**
	* point-to-point connections 
* SPI (Serial Peripheral Interconnect) [一對多]
	* drawback: **the number of pins required**
	* a master to a slave → 4 lines (MISO, MOSI, SCK, CS1) (MOSI: Master In Slave Out)
	* each additional slave requires one additional chip select I/O pin on the master
* I2C (Inter-IC Communication) [多對多]
	* a multi-master bus
	* use ground line + two lines (**SCL**, **SDA**): Serial Clock, Serial Data
	* one extra bit of meta date (ACK/NACK) out of every 8 bits
	* hardware required: more complex than SPI, less than async serial.
	* I2C can be fairly trivially implemented in software. 用軟件來實現I2C協議是相對簡單的
	* The clock signal is always **generated by the current bus master**
		* some slave devices may **force the clock low** at times to delay the master sending more data → **clock stretching** 類似暫停
	* **open drain**
		* they can pull the signal line low, but cannot drive it high → **Wired-AND**
		* each signal line has a common **pull-up resistor**

		 * Start Condition: **SCL high**, **SDA low** (SDA )
		 * Stop Condition: **SCL high**, **SDA high**
