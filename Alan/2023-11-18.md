* Genetic Algorithm: evolution based on fitness score
* Parameter Space
	* alpha research: develop single alpha -> develop alpha space to search
* Fitness Score
	* f(x1, x2, x3)
	* what defines a good scoring for alpha, or anything in your life
	* border effect / marginal utility 邊界效應
		* Figure too bad -> high penalty
		* Figure very good -> less reward
		* Need to contain all factors
* Data Explorer
	* use API to fetch data sets/fields
		* find data fields for signal generation
		* fetch group for group operators
* Illiquid_Minvolum universe
	* 1, 2, 3, ..., 3000, 3001, ...
	* GLB/TWN/ASI region, Local competition: USA/ASI/TWN
	* Risk handling: SLOW, FAST, SLOW_AND_FAST
* Super Alphas
	* Combo
		* use expression to adjust each alpha's weight
		* main idea: what alpha should receive higher/lower weight?
	* What's the advantage for  Super Alphas, compare to ensemble alphas
		* separate-able
		* value from combo
		* each alpha is fully-optimizd
		* position level ensemble, instead of expression level ensemble
