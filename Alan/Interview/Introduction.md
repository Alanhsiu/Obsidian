Hi, I'm Cheng-Hsiu Hsieh, studying Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. 

My main interest lies in physical design and IC design. I've been involved in some cool EDA projects, like the CADContest at ICCAD where my team and I won first place in "3D Placement with Macros", and I also got second place in the CADathlon. Those were great experiences in solving real-world problems and working as a team.

I've also collaborated with Delta Electronics on a project for PCB Layout Design Automation. My role was mostly focused on trace routing, and I learned a lo from that.

Outside of classes and projects, I've enjoyed being part of student groups and doing various activities, which has really helped me with teamwork and staying organized.

I'm super excited about the idea of joining NVIDIA for the Physical Design Summer Internship. I'm eager to bring what I've learned to the table and learn even more from the team there."
