* Question
	* 實習具體會做些什麼？
	* 會有先training嗎？具體是如何規劃時程？
	* 會要一直碰那些tool嗎？還是可以寫演算法？
	* 會希望我做出來的東西可以對公司有實際貢獻！
	* 面試很寶貴，想請問面試官對我的生涯規劃（或目前的修課）有什麼想法？

Hi, I'm Cheng-Hsiu Hsieh, studying Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. I've been lucky enough to get some recognition for my academics, like the Presidential Award and making it onto the Dean's List, which has been pretty encouraging.

My main interest lies in physical and IC design. I've been involved in some cool EDA projects, like the CADContest at ICCAD where my team and I won first place in 3D Placement with Macros, and we also snagged second place in the CADathlon. Those were great experiences in solving real-world problems and working as a team.

I've also collaborated with Delta Electronics on a project for PCB Layout Design Automation. My role was mostly focused on trace routing, and I learned a ton from that.

Outside of classes and projects, I've enjoyed being part of student groups and doing various activities, which has really helped me with teamwork and staying organized.

I'm super excited about the idea of joining NVIDIA for the Physical Design Summer Internship. I'm eager to bring what I've learned to the table and learn even more from the team there."
