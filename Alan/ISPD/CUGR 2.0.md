* Previous Works
	* Labyrinth: pattern route (L or Z)
	* FastRoute: congestion driven Steiner tree / edge shifting 
	* FastRoute 2.0: monotonic routing (for 2-pin nets)
	* PathFinder: negotiation based rip-up and reroute
	* NCTU-GR: history term gradually wear off
	* BOXRouter, SideWinder, GRIP: concurrent routing (use ILP)
	* SPRoute: soft capacity
	* FastGR, Gamer: use GPUs
* Proposed Algorithm
	* construct a routing DAG for a net
	* use dynamic programming
