* Alpha class
	Alpha: local name, payload , alpha_stage, running_data, response_data
	running, response: init as an empty dictionary
	
* Worker simulation flow-chart
	* multi-simulation
	* check running alpha
		* if full, skip
		* if not, insert alphas,
	* load alpha, get location)url
	* if retry-after == 0
		* update response_data
		* get pnu tvr
		* patch info

* What is an alpha
	* due to the inefficient market
	* long-short balance
	* market structure

* If we want to focus on 1-datafield driven Alphas, what should be the computational steps from the start to the end
	* Data Cleaning: backfill, outliers
	* Data Normalization: set your comparison ground
	* Data Comparison: Identify your long-short position
	* Alpha Adjustment: Apply decay, risk-neutral or other steps to improve Alpha performance
* What is the research scope
